This course spent a lot of my time because almost every week we have to finish a project. We must work on 8 individual projects, 1 group project, and 1 paper study. 
the real dataset from real companies including Hertz, Humana, Jo-Ann, VCA, Famous Footwear, ...etc. We also have to select a paper in the field of marketing analytics and make comments on it.
