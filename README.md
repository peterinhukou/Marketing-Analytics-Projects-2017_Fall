This course spent majority of my time because almost every week we have to finish one project. We have to work on 8 individual projects, 1 group project, and 1 paper study. The instructor Mike Grigsby, based on his work in marketing analytics industry, offered the real datasets from real companies including Hertz, Humana, Jo-Ann, VCA, Famous Footwear, ...etc. Each dataset has thousands of observations and nearly hundred of variables. We've learned to implement the following analytics : OLS, Segmentation, Logistic, Marketing Basbet Analysis, Survival Modeling, Price Elasticity, Panel, Poisson, ...etc. I implemented SAS for most of these analytics except segmentation. For segmentation I always used Latent instead of K-means. 
In addition to analysis on real datasets, every student had to select one paper in the field of marketing analytics and made a 10-minute presentation to the class. The presentation must include the methodology of the selected paper and our comments on it. I selected a British paper with the title of "Estimation of Price Elasticities of Demand for Alcohol in the United Kingdom". My paper study presenttaion is scored 100.
