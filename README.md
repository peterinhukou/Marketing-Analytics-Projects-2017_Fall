This course spent majority of my time because almost every week I have to finish one project. The students have to work on 8 individual projects, 1 group project, and 1 paper study. The instructor Mike Grigsby, based on his work in marketing analytics industry, offered the real datasets from real companies including Hertz, Humana, Jo-Ann, VCA, Famous Footwear, ...etc. Each dataset has thousands of observations and some dataset has hundred variables. I've learned to implement the following analytics : OLS, Segmentation, Logistic, Marketing Basket Analysis, Survival Modeling, Price Elasticity, Panel, Poisson, ...etc. I implemented SAS for most of these analytics except segmentation. For segmentation I always applied Latent instead of K-means because Latent is much more stable and precise. 
In addition to analysis on real datasets, every student had to select one paper in the field of marketing analytics and made a 10-minute presentation to the class. The presentation must include the methodology of the selected paper and our comments on it. I selected a British paper with the title of "Estimation of Price Elasticities of Demand for Alcohol in the United Kingdom". My presenttaion is scored 100.
